# mToolkit Framework

The mToolkit Framework is a versatile and portable software development framework designed to facilitate the creation, deployment, and management of modular tools and applications. It consists of three main components: the component library, the desktop launcher, and Tools.

- **Component Library:** This is a collection of classes and systems essential for the operation of Tools. It provides functionality such as managing workspaces for file operations, storing variables and values in a Tool Configuration file, handling complex data structures, and offering a Pipeline infrastructure for inter-tool communication.

- **Desktop Launcher:** This executable application serves as the platform for loading and displaying the user interface (UI) of Tools. It also provides additional features such as installing Tools from Zip files.

- **Tools:** These are portable, self-contained C# and WPF-powered library classes that utilize a mTool class to create a UserControl for presenting the UI to users. Each Tool is designed to perform specific tasks and can interact with the desktop launcher and other Tools via the Pipeline infrastructure.

The mToolkit Framework is a modular software development solution that streamlines the process of creating, deploying, and managing self-contained, portable tools and applications through its component library, desktop launcher, and Tools system. It offers a rich set of features for handling UI, file management, and communication between Tools, ensuring seamless integration and flexibility for developers.
